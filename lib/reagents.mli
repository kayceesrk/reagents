  (** The type of continuation. *)

  val suspend : ('a cont -> 'a option) -> 'a
  (** [suspend f] applies [f] to the current continuation. If [f] returns
      [Some v], then the function returns [v] immediately.  Otherwise, if [f]
      returns [None], then the current fiber is suspended and the control
      switches to the next fiber from the scheduler. *)

  val resume : 'a cont -> 'a -> unit
  (** [resume k v] prepares to resume the continuation [k] with value [v] and
      enqueues the continuation to the scheduler queue. *)

      [r] (or any reagent constructed using [r]) commits. *)

  val lift : ('a -> 'b) -> ('a, 'b) t
  (** [lift f] lifts a pure function [f] to a reagent. If [f] includes
      side-effects, then the side-effects may be performed zero or more times.
      It is expected that [f] does not perform any blocking operations. *)

  (** The sequential composition operator. [a >>> b] perform [a] and [b]
      atomically. Corresponds to arrow bind. *)

  val ( <+> ) : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b) t
  (** Left-biased choice. [a <+> b] first attempts [a]. If [a] blocks, then [b]
      is attempted. If both of them block, then the whole protocol blocks. *)

  val ( <*> ) : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'c) t -> ('a, 'b * 'c) t
  (** Parallel composition operator. [a <*> b] is only enabled if both [a] and
      [b] are enabled. *)

  val attempt : ('a, 'b) t -> ('a, 'b option) t
  (** Convert a blocking reagent into a non-blocking one. If reagent [r] is a

      a value [v], then [attempt r] returns [Some v]. *)
